# Wordle
A simple [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) clone that removes the limit of one puzzle per day. Since the original uses the current date to determine which puzzle to show, this one just randomizes the date on page refresh.

## Possible future improvements
 - Allow choosing which puzzle to play by number
 - Remove help modal when selecting new puzzle
 - Unminify code
 - Add other languages
